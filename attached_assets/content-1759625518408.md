How long do oil tanks last?

The steel oil tanks that Mercer Fuels installs come with a 25 year warranty. However, every insurance company has different requirements.

Fiberglass oil tanks cost more money than steel tanks, but if your insurance company will cover a fiberglass tank for 10 or more extra years (compared to steel), it is economically more feasible.

How can I tell if my hot water heater is oil or electric?

You’re standing in front of your water heater – now how do you tell if it’s an electric or oil fired model? Start by looking for an access panel on the side of the water heater. If you remove it and see a blue flame, that’s a pilot light, which only oil fired models have. Connected pipes are also indicators of oil, while an electric water heater will simply have a cord going into the top or side of the unit.
