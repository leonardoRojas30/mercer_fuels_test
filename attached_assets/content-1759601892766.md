# Privacy Policy

**MERCER FUELS LIMITED**

**PRIVACY POLICY**

**1\. INTRODUCTION**

At Mercer Fuels Limited (“Mercer Fuels”) we value and respect your privacy and personal

information. The “Privacy Policy” that follows is intended to summarize what personal

information we collect, and how we use, disclose and safeguard this information. As

specified in section 8 of our website Terms of Use, your access and use of our website

constitute acceptance of our Privacy Policy and the terms herein. If you do not agree with

any of the Privacy Policy terms herein, please refrain from using/accessing our website and

providing us with personal/sensitive information. Should you require clarification, please

contact us for further information (see section 7 below).

**2\. FUTURE AMENDMENTS**

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time with or without further

modification to the Terms of Use. However, when amendments to the Privacy Policy are

formalized, we will notify customers via our website and/or via email. To be clear, your

continued use of the website after any such changes would constitute an acceptance of the

revised Privacy Policy.

**3\. COLLECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Personal information is information that can uniquely identify an individual (“Personal

Information”). This may include your full name, contact information including your email

address and phone number, your residential or commercial address, your bank account

and credit card information, as well as any other Personal Information that you may

provide. Mercer Fuels receives this type of information when you voluntarily provide it in

person, via our website, over the phone or via another form of correspondence during

purchases or otherwise, or when you register for a product or service. Using our third party

software, we also automatically collect technological information including, but not limited

to, your domain name, IP address, cookie data, operating system, search queries you’ve

entered on our website, the pages you’ve visited on our website, and the browser you’ve

used to do so. This information allows us to better meet and anticipate the needs of our

customer base and improve the overall management of our company and performance of

our website. To be clear, the amount and type of information that your web browser

provides depends on your own browser’s settings. Please refer to your browser’s

instructions if you would like to change or restrict this permission. Ultimately, the type of

Personal Information we collect in a given circumstance depends on a variety of factors,

including the product you’ve purchased, payment considerations, and the service you’ve

requested.

**4\. OUR USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

The Personal Information that we collect may be used for the purposes for which it was

originally collected, in accordance with this Privacy Policy and governing law, or for other

purposes to which you knowingly assent. This includes, but is not limited to, disclosing

your Personal Information internally within our company or to third party service

providers and contractors where the service, product purchase, shipping or installation,

promotional activity, or customer request/query requires it. We may also disclose your

Personal Information in order to carry out any other purpose required and legally

authorized or to which you knowingly consent. We reserve the right to transfer Personal

Information in the event that we merge with or are acquired by another entity.

**5\. PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION** At Mercer Fuels, we consider the security and protection of your Personal Information to

be paramount. To protect it, we maintain physical, organizational and technological

safeguards appropriate in the circumstances. This means that the mechanism or approach

we employ to safeguard your Personal Information is based on the level of sensitivity of the

information in question and our organizational construct for the specific service or

product. Personal Information may only be accessed by persons within our organization

who need this information in order to provide you with the services you require or have

requested. As per section 4 above, we provide third party service providers and

contractors with your Personal Information where warranted, but we only provide as

much information as is necessary for them to complete their contracted task. Further, we

retain Personal Information only as long as is required given the service request or

purchase in question, or as is required under statutory law. We remove and securely

destroy Personal Information once it is no longer needed by our company.

**6\. ACCESS AND CORRECTION** You have the right to access your Personal Information that you have provided us. Further,

you may request a correction should you believe there is an inaccuracy or error in the

Personal Information that we have collected. To do either, please contact us (see section 7

below).

including the terms described herein, please contact us at contact@mercerfuels.com, 902-
